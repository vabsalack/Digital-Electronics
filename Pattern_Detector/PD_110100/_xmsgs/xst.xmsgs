<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2371" delta="unknown" >HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
